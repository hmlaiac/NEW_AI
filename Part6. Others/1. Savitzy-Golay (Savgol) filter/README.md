# Inspirations:
We can use convolution to smooth noisy data. The idea is to use a window of size n, and then take the average of the data points in the window. The window then moves to the right by one data point, and the process repeats. The result is a smoothed curve.

One of usage of convolution is to calculate the product of two very large numbers, according to Youtube.
