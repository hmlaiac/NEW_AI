# Introduction

Welcome to the reinforcement learning project! In this project, you will implement a value iteration agent and a
Q-learning agent. You will test your agents first on Gridworld (from class), then apply them to a simulated robot
controller (Crawler) and Pacman.

# Prerequisites
python 3.8 or above
